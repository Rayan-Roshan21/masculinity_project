# Masculinity Project

## Overview

This project analyzes survey data on masculinity, visualizes relationships between responses, and uses KMeans clustering to identify patterns in the data.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Exploration:** Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and key features.
2. **Data Mapping:** Conversion of survey responses into numerical values for analysis.
3. **Visualization:** Scatter plots to explore relationships between selected variables.
4. **Clustering:** Application of KMeans to group responses into clusters.
5. **Cluster Analysis:** Interpretation of clusters to draw insights.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install them using pip if needed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Place the `masculinity.csv` dataset in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python masculinity_project.py
   ```
3. View the outputs, including cluster centers and educational level analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset (`masculinity.csv`) contains responses to various questions on masculinity, including:
- Frequency of asking friends for professional or personal advice.
- Opinions and behaviors related to masculinity.

## Outputs

- Scatter plots visualizing relationships between variables.
- Cluster centers representing patterns in the data.
- Educational level distributions within each cluster.
